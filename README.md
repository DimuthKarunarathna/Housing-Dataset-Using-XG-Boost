# Housing Dataset Analysis Using XGBoost

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the Ames Housing Dataset to predict house sale prices using XGBoost regression. The dataset contains 81 features describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, with the goal of accurately predicting SalePrice.

## Dataset Information

- **Training Data**: 1,460 samples with 81 features
- **Test Data**: 1,459 samples with 80 features (excluding SalePrice)
- **Target Variable**: SalePrice (continuous)
- **Features**: Mix of numerical and categorical variables including:
  - Physical characteristics (LotArea, GrLivArea, YearBuilt, etc.)
  - Quality ratings (OverallQual, OverallCond, etc.)
  - Location features (Neighborhood, MSZoning, etc.)
  - Amenities (GarageArea, PoolArea, etc.)

## Current Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
- Basic missing value handling (median for numerical, "None" for categorical)
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- No feature engineering or advanced preprocessing

### Model Configuration
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Regressor
- **Cross-validation**: 10-fold StratifiedKFold
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - n_estimators: 1000
  - learning_rate: 0.01
  - max_depth: 6
  - subsample: 0.8
  - colsample_bytree: 0.8
  - reg_alpha: 1
  - reg_lambda: 1

### Current Performance
- **Cross-validation RMSE**: ~25,469
- **Model**: Single XGBoost with early stopping

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost statsmodels
```

### Running the Analysis
1. Download the Ames Housing Dataset from Kaggle
2. Place the dataset files in the appropriate directory
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook

## Methodology

### Data Exploration
- Descriptive statistics and data type analysis
- Missing value identification
- Distribution analysis of target variable
- Correlation analysis between features and target
- Visualization of key relationships

### Model Training
- 10-fold cross-validation with stratified sampling
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Out-of-fold predictions for validation

## Results and Analysis

### Current Limitations
1. **High RMSE**: 25,469 indicates significant prediction error
2. **Basic Preprocessing**: Limited feature engineering
3. **No Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using default parameters
4. **Single Model**: No ensemble methods
5. **No Target Transformation**: SalePrice distribution not optimized

### Key Findings
- Strong correlation between OverallQual and SalePrice
- Neighborhood significantly impacts house prices
- YearBuilt shows positive correlation with price
- Some features have high missing value rates

## Areas for Improvement

### High Priority Improvements
1. **Target Variable Transformation**
   - Apply log transformation to handle SalePrice skewness
   - Consider other transformations (Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson)

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create house age feature (current year - YearBuilt)
   - Combine related area features (TotalSF = GrLivArea + TotalBsmtSF)
   - Quality × Area interaction features
   - Neighborhood price statistics

3. **Advanced Preprocessing**
   - Handle outliers in numerical features
   - Implement proper categorical encoding (One-Hot, Target Encoding)
   - Feature scaling for numerical variables

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
   - Grid search or Bayesian optimization
   - Cross-validation with proper scoring metrics

### Medium Priority Improvements
1. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Combine XGBoost with LightGBM and CatBoost
   - Stacking or blending multiple models
   - Voting regressors

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Recursive feature elimination
   - LASSO regularization
   - Correlation-based selection

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Residual analysis
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Model interpretability tools

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Modular Structure**
   - Separate preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation functions
   - Configuration management
   - Proper error handling

2. **Documentation**
   - Detailed function documentation
   - Code comments and explanations
   - Performance benchmarks

## Expected Performance Gains

With the suggested improvements, the model performance could improve significantly:
- **Target transformation**: 10-15% RMSE reduction
- **Feature engineering**: 15-25% RMSE reduction
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: 5-10% RMSE reduction
- **Ensemble methods**: 5-15% RMSE reduction

**Total expected improvement**: 35-65% reduction in RMSE

## Future Enhancements

1. **Deep Learning Integration**
   - Neural networks for complex feature interactions
   - AutoML frameworks

2. **Real-time Predictions**
   - API development
   - Web application interface

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - SHAP values for model interpretability
   - Partial dependence plots
   - Individual conditional expectation plots
